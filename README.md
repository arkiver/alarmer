Alarmer

Here's the problem I face: 

Sometimes I need to wake up early in the morning say 6 AM. I set an alarm for 6 AM. Now, just so that I don't switch 
off the 6 AM alarm and go back to sleep, I set a few more alarms - 5:45 AM , 5:55 AM, 6:10 AM and 6:15 AM. 

Now I have to set 5 alarms ! And I am super lazy when choosing the right time from the android timepicker wheel ui.
And since I am usually very sleepy when I'm setting the alarm at night, I get annoyed sometimes. 

Hence, Alarmer. Alarmer solves this problem by automatically setting 5 alarms for every alarm that I set. 

Alarmer would check the time and set few alarms before the alarm time and few alarms after the alarm time at
specific durations. 

The code is terrible and super hackish right now (maybe because of my 'awesome' android skills) but I plan to 
make it right soon. 

Any contributions are welcome :)
